# Licensing and Disclaimer

This repository includes descriptions of feature extraction pipelines that
utilize third-party and vendor-provided software.

## Third-Party and Proprietary Components

- PyRadiomics is an open-source library and is cited accordingly.
- Deep learning–based feature extraction (DenseNet121 and ShuffleNet3D)
  is implemented using **onekey platform code**, which is proprietary.

The proprietary code is **not included** in this repository.

## Reproducibility Statement

The absence of proprietary source code does not prevent reproduction of the
proposed method. Researchers may substitute equivalent feature extraction
pipelines as long as they adhere to the specified feature interface.

## Intended Use

This repository is intended for academic research and method evaluation only.
Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with data privacy and licensing
requirements.
